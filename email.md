Below is a straightforward checklist for adding inbound email support to your existing PDF ingestion pipeline, broken into small, self-contained steps.
---
1. ✅ Select or Configure an Inbound Email Service
- ✅ Decided on AWS SES
- ✅ Created necessary credentials (using existing AWS setup)
- ✅ Verified domain setup (mail.paperpusher.calemcnulty.com)
- ✅ DNS propagation complete
- ✅ SES domain verification successful

2. ✅ Set Up an Inbound Webhook
- ✅ Created S3 bucket (paperpusher-inbound-email)
- ✅ Set up S3 bucket policy for SES
- ✅ Configured webhook (using S3 event notifications)

3. ✅ Define the Webhook Payload Contract
- ✅ Using S3 event notifications
- ✅ Focusing only on PDF attachments
- ✅ Defined success/failure response format

4. ✅ Implement an Inbound Email Handler
- ✅ Created Lambda function structure
- ✅ Set up TypeScript + build pipeline
- ✅ Implemented email parsing
- ✅ Added PDF attachment filtering
- ✅ Using existing email handling role (solvd-email-handling-role-6pvcojp7)
- ✅ Added S3 permissions:
  - s3:ListBucket on bucket
  - s3:GetObject on objects

5. ✅ Queue or Invoke the Existing "Process-PDF" Logic
- ✅ Set up S3 trigger for Lambda
- ✅ Added proper error handling
- ✅ Added logging/monitoring

6. ✅ Observability Setup
- ✅ Added CloudWatch logging (via Lambda role)
- ✅ Set up error tracking (in Lambda handler)
- ✅ Added monitoring metrics (via CloudWatch)

7. ⏳ Test the Flow
- ✅ Domain verification complete
- ✅ Lambda function deployed and executing
- ✅ S3 permissions configured
- ⏳ Test with SES sandbox
- ⏳ Verify PDF processing
- ⏳ Test error scenarios

Implementation Notes:
- Lambda function code in `lambda/inbound-email/`
- Using `mailparser` for robust email parsing
- TypeScript setup with esbuild for bundling
- Following project standards (file/function size limits)
- Integrated with existing AWS infrastructure
- Using existing Lambda role with proper permissions

Current Status:
1. DNS Records Successfully Configured:
   - ✅ MX record: `10 inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`
   - ✅ TXT record (SPF): `v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all`
   - ✅ TXT record (SES): `SHur2ISKGwAbp7IDikGNlc2azM+HNV18YGsLlE2ephQ=`
   - ✅ All records propagated and verified by AWS

2. Lambda Function Deployed:
   - ✅ Function name: `paperpusher-email-handler`
   - ✅ Runtime: Node.js 18.x
   - ✅ Memory: 256MB
   - ✅ Timeout: 30 seconds
   - ✅ Using existing role: `solvd-email-handling-role-6pvcojp7`
   - ✅ Required S3 permissions added:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
             "s3:ListBucket"
           ],
           "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::paperpusher-inbound-email"
         },
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
             "s3:GetObject"
           ],
           "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::paperpusher-inbound-email/*"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

Next Steps:
1. ✅ S3 permissions added to Lambda role
2. Test email flow with sample PDF attachments:
   - Send test email to: test@mail.paperpusher.calemcnulty.com
   - Monitor Lambda metrics for execution
   - Verify PDF processing in Supabase
3. Set up production monitoring alerts if needed

Note: The email infrastructure is now fully configured and verified by AWS. The Lambda function is executing (confirmed by metrics) but we need CloudWatch log access to debug the full flow. The function has all necessary permissions for S3 and should be able to process emails and forward PDFs to Supabase.
